# hello-world

Hi!

I am a college student. I am trying to learn things my college does not offer as coursework.
My goals are to learn as much as I can in new languages (especially R, C#, and others) and further my
knowledge in C++, Java, CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.

I have been learning CSS/HTML since I first customized my user page on a web-based game. I was eight years
old. I have learned these completely on my own.

I enjoy web development and creating applications in C++. I appreciate any
support I can get from this community.

Thanks for reading! :)
